    This is the initial release of the networking-baremetal. The project
    includes the ``baremetal`` ml2 mechanism driver performing binding of
    the Networking service ports with ``binding_vnic_type=baremetal`` in
    flat networks. It also includes the devstack plugin to simplify the
    development setup and testing.
