    Add support for type ``vlan`` networks in baremetal ml2 mechanism driver.
    This enables binding on networks using vlans for segmentation. It is only
    setting type ``vlan`` as supported. The intent is to use this in
    combination with another neutron mechanism driver that actually knows how
    to configure the network devices.

    .. Note:: The driver will **not** do anything to **set up** the correct
              **vlan tagging** in the network infrastructure such as switches
              or baremetal node ports.

              Another ml2 mechanism driver, or some other implementation, must
              be enabled to perform the necessary configuration on network
              devices.
