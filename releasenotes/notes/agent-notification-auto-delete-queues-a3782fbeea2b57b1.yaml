    oslo.messaging notification queues are now renamed and created with
    ``amqp_auto_delete=true``. When upgrading the agent old queues should be
    deleted to free up message broker resources. Previous queue that can be
    deleted are named ``ironic-neutron-agent-heartbeat.info``. There may
    also be queues with uuid of previous agent instances as name, these can
    also safely be deleted. (Look in the agent logs for relevant agent uuids).

    On rabbitmq queues can be deleted via the web console. For example with
    curl::

      curl -i -u username:password \
        -H "content-type:application/json" -XDELETE \
        http://<host>:<web-port>/api/queues/<vhost>/<queue-name>

    Another example with vhost: '/' deleting the
    ironic-neutron-agent-heartbeat.info queue::

      curl -i -u username:password \
        -H "content-type:application/json" \
        -XDELETE \
        http://172.20.0.1:15672/api/queues/%2F/ironic-neutron-agent-heartbeat.info

    .. Note:: In the example above the vhost is ``/``.
              To ensure the vhost is correctly encoded the use of ``%2F``,
              instead of ``/`` is required.

    Fixes an issue where old oslo.messaging notification pool queues remained
    in the broker without any consumer after agent restart. The notification
    queues will now be created with ``amqp_auto_delete=true``. See `bug:
    2004933 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2004933>`_.
