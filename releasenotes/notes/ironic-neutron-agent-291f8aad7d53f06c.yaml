features:
  - Add neutron agent ``ironic-neutron-agent`` to enable integration with
    neutron routed provider networks. The ml2 agent reports the state of
    ironic ports associated with ironic nodes to neutron, it populates the
    bridge_mappings configuration for each ironic node. The agent data can be
    used by the neutron segments plug-in in conjunction with neutron ml2
    mechanism driver to ensure that port binding and ipam ip address
    allocations are taken from subnets associated with physical network
    segments available to the ironic port.
