    Adds support for load distribution when multiple instances of the
    networking-baremetal agent are running. Each instance will manage a subset
    of bare metal nodes. In case one or more instances of networking-baremetal
    agent is lost, the remaining instances will take over the bare metal nodes
    previously managed by the lost instance(s).
