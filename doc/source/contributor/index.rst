This document provides some necessary points for developers to consider when
writing and reviewing networking-baremetal code.

Getting Started
===============

If you're completely new to OpenStack and want to contribute to the
networking-baremetal project, please start by familiarizing yourself with the
`Infra Team's Developer Guide
<https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html>`_. This will
help you get your accounts set up in Launchpad and Gerrit, familiarize you with
the workflow for the OpenStack continuous integration and testing systems, and
help you with your first commit.

LaunchPad Project
-----------------

Most of the tools used for OpenStack require a launchpad.net ID for
authentication.
