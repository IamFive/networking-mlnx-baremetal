python-ufmclient
---------------------------

This package should be a separated project in theory. Currently, mellanox
does not provide an open source UFM REST API client. We simply put a rough
ufmclient here which only contains authentication and PKey module. In case
there has a full edition *python-ufmclient*, it can be easily replaced.
